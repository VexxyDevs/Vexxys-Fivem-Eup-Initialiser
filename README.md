# Vexxys-Fivem-Eup-Initialiser
 (EUP Resource)



this is my server base for eup that also i decided to put my simple mechanic script in it to :sob: so your welcome i guess.




Folder explanation:


Stream (folder)  - folder to put your eup files, custom weapon files and stuff like that

S (folder)  -  folder for the script (eup initialiser and simple mechanic script)

Fxmanifest.lua (file)   - file for the whole resource to work



(IMPORTANT, THIS DOENST INCLUDE CLOTHING FILES OR CUSTOM WEAPON FILES THIS IS JUST A RESOURCE TO INITIALISE THEM)


dependencies -

Mythic_Notify (included in the script so all u gotta do is drag it out of the zip and out of this resource and start mythic_notify then this script)
